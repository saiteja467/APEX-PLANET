                Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, transmitted the science of Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis. He expounded 112 ways through which human beings can transcend their limitations. Adiyogiâ€™s offerings are tools for individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world.
